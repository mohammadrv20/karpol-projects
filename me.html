<h1>Early Life (c. 570 CE - 610 CE) <br> </h1> 
    
     <li>Born into a merchant family in Mecca (now in Saudi Arabia) around 570 CE.</li>
     <li>Orphaned at a young age, raised by his grandfather and uncle.</li>
     <li>Known for his honesty and trustworthiness, earning the nickname "al-Sadiq" (the truthful).</li>
     <li>Worked as a merchant, traveling throughout the Arabian Peninsula.</li>
     <li>Married Khadijah, a wealthy widow, and became a respected member of Meccan society.</li>
    <h2>The Revelation (610 CE) <br> </h2>    
     <li>At the age of 40, Muhammad experienced a pivotal moment in a cave near Mecca. <br> According to Islamic tradition, he received the first revelation from God (Allah) through the angel Gabriel.
     <li>These revelations would continue for the next 23 years, forming the basis of the Quran, the holy book of Islam.</li>
    
   <h2> Preaching Islam and Facing Opposition (610 CE - 622 CE) </h2> <br>
    
    <li> Muhammad began preaching Islam, a monotheistic religion that emphasized social justice, compassion, and submission to God's will.</li>
    <li>His teachings challenged the polytheistic practices of the Meccan elite, who faced a potential loss of power and prestige.</li>
    <li></li>Muhammad and his followers faced persecution and ridicule from the Quraysh tribe, the ruling class of Mecca.</li>
    
    <h2>The Hijra (Migration) and Building a Community (622 CE - 630 CE)</h2>
    
    <li>In 622 CE, fearing for the safety of his followers, Muhammad led a migration (Hijra) from Mecca to Medina, a city about 270 km north.</li>
    <li>In Medina, Muhammad established the first Muslim community, laying the foundation for Islamic social and political structures.</li>
    <li>Muslims and Meccans clashed in several battles, with the Muslims eventually emerging victorious.</li>
    
   <h2> Return to Mecca and Final Years (630 CE - 632 CE)</h2>
    
    <li>In 630 CE, Muslims marched on Mecca, and the city surrendered peacefully. <br> Muhammad destroyed the idols in the Kaaba, a cubical structure revered by Arabs, and rededicated it to the worship of Allah.</li>
    <li>Islam gained momentum throughout Arabia. Muhammad performed the Farewell Pilgrimage, establishing the rituals of Hajj for future generations.</li>
    <li>He died in Medina in 632 CE, leaving behind a legacy that continues to shape the world today.</li>
